#### End Notes

Thank you Salesken for giving me such a new kind of task, before this task I had naver heard about Canvas API.
For this task Initially I have done so much of google search and in that process ended up to the best tutorial which is available on MDN itself, here is the link

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial

Now I know at least the basics of Canvs API which I have learned and used in this task, Hope you will like it.
